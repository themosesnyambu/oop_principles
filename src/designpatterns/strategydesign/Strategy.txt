The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one
and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

--> Design Principle
        Identify the parts of your program that vary and separate them
        from what stays the same

        Program to an interface and not an implementation
