Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing 
only functionality to the user

In Java it is achieved through Abstract classes (0-100%) and Interfaces (100%)

--> Abstract Class
    Class which contain abstract keyword in its declaration
    They may or may not contain abstract methods
    An abstract class cannot be instantiated
    A subclass must implement all abstract methods

    --> Abstract Methods
        Use abstract keyword 
        Contains method signature but no keyword
        The class containing it must be declared as abstract
        Any class inheriting the current class must either override the abstract
        method or declare itself as abstract
