Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform a dingle task in
different ways.
A single entity(object) behaves differently in different cases

There are two types:
    1) Static (Compile Time) Polymorphism
    2) Dynamic (Runtime ) Polymorphism


Polymorphism can be primarily achieved by sub-classing or implementing
an interface

Polymorphism can make use of inheritance to add dynamic behavior in the code

Advantages of Polymorphism:
    1) We can achieve flexibility in our code because we can perform various
       operations by using methods with the same names according to requirements
    2) The main benefit is when we provide implementation to abstract class
       or interface

while in inheritance the child class inherits behavior from parent class, in
polymorphism the child redefines already defined behavior

--> Static polymorphism
        object binding with methods happens at compile time 
        The behavior of a method is decided based on the parameters of method
        It can be achieved by method overloading, constructor overloading 
        or method hiding


--> Dynamic Polymorphism
        Object binding with methods happens at runtime
        JVM binds the method call with method definition at runtime and
        invokes the relevant method during runtime when the method is called
        This happens because objects are created at runtime and method is
        called using an object of the class

        It can be achieved using overriding
